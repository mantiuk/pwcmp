function [Q, R] = pw_scale( D, options )
% Scaling method for pairwise comparisons, also for non-balanced
% (incomplete) designs.
%
% [Q, R] = pw_scale( D, options )
%
% D - NxN matrix with positive integers. D(i,j) = k means that the
%     condition i was better than j in k number of trials.
% options - a cell array with the options. Currently recognized options:
%	   'prior' - type of the distance prior in the available options are:
%
%                'none': do not use prior;
%                'bounded': unsurance that the distance between quality 
%                scores is within a bounded range, adaptively selected in
%                each iteration of the MLE optimization;
%                'gaussian': the normalised sum of probabilities of 
%                observing a difference for all compared pairs of conditions.
%
%                Set to 'gaussian' by default. Bounded is faster to compute
%                than Gaussian but is also marginally worse in the simulation
%                results.
%
%       'regularization' - Since the quality scores in pairwise comparisons
%                are relative and the absolute value cannot be obtained, it
%                is necessary to make an assumption how the absolute values
%                are fixed in the optimization. The two options are:
%
%                'mean0' - add a regularization term that makes the mean
%                JOD value equal to 0. 
%                'fix0' - fix the score of the first condition to 0. That
%                score is not optimized. 
%
%                The default is 'mean0'. 'mean0' results in a reduced
%                overall estimation error as compared to 'fix0'. 'fix0' is 
%                useful when one of the conditions is considered a
%                baseline or a reference. The conditioons closer to that
%                reference will be estimated with higher accuracy. 
%
% Q - the JOD value for each method. The difference of 1 corresponds to
%     75% of answers selecting one condition over another.
% R - matrix of residuals. The residuals are due to projecting the
%     differences into 1D space. These are the differences between the
%     distances corresponding to the probabilities observed in the
%     experiment and the resulting distances after scaling. 
%
% The condition with index 1 (the first row in D) has the score fixed at value
% 0. Always put "reference" condition at index 1. The measurement error is
% the smallest for the conditions that are the closest to the reference
% condition.
%
% The method scaled the data by solving for maximum-likelihood-estimator
% explaining the collected data. The principle is similar to Bradley-Terry
% model, but Gaussian and not logistic function is used to model relation
% between probabilities and distances in the scaled space. Similar
% scaling was proposed in:
%
% Silverstein, D., & Farrell, J. (2001). Efficient method for paired
% comparison. Journal of Electronic Imaging, 10, 394-398. doi:10.1117/1.1344187
%
% However, the method contains a number of extensions improving robustness,
% eliminating bias and allowing computing confidence intervals (with
% pw_scale_bootstrp function).
